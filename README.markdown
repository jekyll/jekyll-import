jekyll-import
=============

The new __Jekyll__ command for importing from various blogs to Jekyll format.

**Note: _migrators_ are now called _importers_ and are only available if one installs the `jekyll-import` _gem_.**

How `jekyll-import` works:
---

Install the _rubygem_ with `gem install jekyll-import`
* In your IRB/Ruby configurations, `require jekyll-import`
* For CLI uses, the newly installed CLI command is now a Jekyll plugin/sub-command invoked with `jekyll import`

Read [Blog migrations](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/) for more detailed info.
