If you're switching to Jekyll from another blogging system, Jekyll's importers can help you with the move. Most importers listed on this site
require read-access to the database from your old system to generate posts for Jekyll. Importers typically generates Markdown posts in the
`_posts` directory based on the entries in the foreign system.

## Other Systems

If you are from a system for which there is currently no importer, [consider writing one][creating_importer] and sending us a pull request.
