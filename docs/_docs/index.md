If you’re switching to Jekyll from another blogging system, Jekyll’s importers
can help you with the move. Most methods listed on this page require read access
to the database from your old system to generate posts for Jekyll. Each method
generates `.markdown` posts in the `_posts` directory based on the entries in
the foreign system.

## Other Systems

If you have a system for which there is currently no migrator, consider writing
one and sending us [a pull request](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import).
