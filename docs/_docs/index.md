If you're switching to Jekyll from another blogging system, Jekyll's importers can help you with the move. Most methods listed on this page
require read access to the database from your old system to generate posts for Jekyll. Each method generates `.markdown` posts in the `_posts`
directory based on the entries in the foreign system.

## Other Systems

If you have a system for which there is currently no migrator, [consider writing one][creating_importer] and sending us a pull request.
