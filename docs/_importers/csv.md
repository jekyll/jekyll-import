Your CSV file will be read in with the following columns:

1. title
2. permalink
3. body
4. published_at
5. filter (e.g. markdown, textile)

If you wish to specify custom front matter for each of your posts, you can use
the `--no-front-matter` option to prevent the default front matter from being
written to the imported files.
