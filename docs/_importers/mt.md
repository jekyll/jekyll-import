Posts will be generated and placed in `_posts` directory.

`comments`, which defaults to false, control the generation of comments. If `comments` is set to true, posts will be generated and placed in
`_comments` directory.

All of the posts and comments will include `post_id` in YAML front matter to link a post and its comments.

You can use the [fork of mt-static-comments][fork of mt-static-comments] to include statically generate comments in your post.
