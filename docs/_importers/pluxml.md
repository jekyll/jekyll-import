To import your posts and drafts from a PluXML blog, run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ruby -r rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::Pluxml.run({
      "source" => "/pluxml/data/articles",
      "layout" => "your_layout",
      "avoid_liquid" => true
    })'
{% endhighlight %}

The `source` field is required.

The `layout` field is optional, it will set the layout in each post and draft imported.

The `avoid_liquid` field is optional, it will add `render_with_liquid: false` option in the header of each file. Usefull if you have Ã  lot of source code to show to your visitors.
